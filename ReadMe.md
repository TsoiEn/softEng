# Technology Selection Documentation

This document outlines various technologies and their suitability for managing student credentials within a web application.

## Technology Overview

### 1. Web3.js

- **Purpose**: Web3.js is primarily used for interacting with Ethereum or other blockchain networks.
- **Use Case**: While Web3.js is excellent for integrating blockchain functionality, it may not be the best fit for managing student credentials in a traditional sense. Blockchain can be used to verify and store hashes of credentials to ensure integrity and immutability but is less practical for storing large amounts of data due to cost and scalability issues.
- **Recommended For**: Use Web3.js if you want to implement blockchain-based verification for credentials, like ensuring that credentials haven't been tampered with. It is not recommended for the primary storage of student data.

### 2. React.js

- **Purpose**: React.js is a front-end JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **Use Case**: React.js can be used to build the user interface of your application, where students, administrators, or educators can interact with the system.
- **Recommended For**: Use React.js to create a dynamic and responsive front-end where users can input, view, and manage student credentials. It can also be integrated with other technologies for managing the data.

### 3. Django

- **Purpose**: Django is a Python-based web framework designed for building robust back-end systems.
- **Use Case**: Django is well-suited for managing and storing student credentials, as it includes features for data management, authentication, and security. It can handle database operations and provide an administrative interface for managing records.
- **Recommended For**: Use Django as the back-end for securely storing and managing student credentials. Django's ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) can efficiently handle database interactions, and its built-in authentication features can be used to manage user access and permissions.
